### React Native in Typescript

This repo aims to take a vanilla JS React Native app, and transform it into a working awesome TypeScript one.

It is a sibling project to [relational-theory](https://github.com/alloy/relational-theory) which strives to build a similar system but from a web perspective.

Aims:

- [ ] Components all have defined State / Props
- [ ] Hot Module Reloading on Save
- [ ] Babel Transformations work for Relay
- [ ] Source Mapping works
- [ ] Testing / Watcher mode in Jest is üëç
