### React Native in Typescript

This repo aims to take a vanilla JS React Native app, and transform it into a working awesome TypeScript one.

It is a sibling project to [relational-theory](https://github.com/alloy/relational-theory) which strives to build a similar system but from a web perspective.

Aims:

- [ ] Components all have defined State / Props
- [ ] Hot Module Reloading on Save
- [ ] Babel Transformations work for Relay
- [ ] Source Mapping works
- [ ] Testing / Watcher mode in Jest is üëç

### Why TypeScript?

There'll probably be a longer write up on the Artsy blog once we've got this stuff in production. However, the TLDR is that TypeScript provides more mature tooling, with the accessability of being built in JavaScript.
