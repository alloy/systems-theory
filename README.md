### React Native in Typescript

This repo aims to take a vanilla JS React Native app, and transform it into a working, awesome, TypeScript one.

It is a sibling project to [relational-theory](https://github.com/alloy/relational-theory) which strives to build a similar system but from a web perspective.

We build specifically for working with VS Code.

Aims:

- [ ] Components all have defined State / Props
- [ ] Hot Module Reloading on Save
- [ ] Source Mapping in debugging works
- [ ] Babel Transformations work for Relay
- [ ] Testing / Watcher mode in Jest is üëç
- [ ] Source Mapping works in Tests

### Why TypeScript?

There'll probably be a longer write up on the Artsy blog once we've got this stuff in production. However, the TLDR is that TypeScript provides more mature tooling, with the accessability of being built in JavaScript.
